This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors app where the user plays against the algorithm.
The app randomly selects one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors) and compares it with the user's choice.
After the comparison, the app displays whether the result was a tie, a victory for the user, or a loss for the user.

This repository contains two versions of the source code: one written in Java and the other in Kotlin.
Both versions were created to test and improve my skills in these programming languages.
The APK release is based on the Kotlin source-code
